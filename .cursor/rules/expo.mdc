- Prefer functional components with React Hooks
- Levarage EXPO SDK features and APIs effectively
- Use Expo Router for structured and navigation
- Manage assets efficiently with Expo's asset system (images, fonts, etc.)
- Use Reanimated for performant animations
- For any logic or algorithm implemented in variables, functions, components, hooks, or helper functions (such as those in `lib/utils`) or any kind that has a logic, algorithm, or conditional, always include comprehensive documentation. Use inline comments or JSDoc to provide explanations, instructions, usage details, and examples
